	Annote = {Uses reverse computation to implement Undo in a cricket scoring system.
        
Recognizes the basic rules used by Perumalla in Rcc, along with the fact that things like increment and subtraction don't require state saving.
        
The reverse code is actually automatically generated in this paper. Forward code is taken, and instrumented forward code, along with reverse code are produced.
        
This is the first paper that seems to automatically generate the instrumented forward code and the reverse code, rather than doing it by hand.},
